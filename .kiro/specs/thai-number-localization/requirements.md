# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Thai localization for number display formats in the system. The system needs to support Buddhist Era (B.E.) year display, maintain Arabic numerals for frontend display, and specifically use Thai numerals for printed bills on both regular printers and portable printers. This ensures proper localization for Thai users while maintaining international compatibility for digital interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Thai user, I want the system to display years in Buddhist Era format, so that I can see dates in the calendar system I'm familiar with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays any year THEN the system SHALL convert Gregorian years to Buddhist Era by adding 543 years
2. WHEN displaying dates on the frontend THEN the system SHALL show B.E. years with "พ.ศ." prefix
3. IF a date input is provided in Gregorian format THEN the system SHALL automatically convert it to B.E. for display
4. WHEN storing dates in the database THEN the system SHALL maintain Gregorian format for data consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user accessing the digital interface, I want numbers to display in Arabic numerals on the frontend, so that the interface remains internationally accessible and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying any numeric content on web frontend THEN the system SHALL use Arabic numerals (0-9)
2. WHEN displaying currency amounts on frontend THEN the system SHALL use Arabic numerals with appropriate Thai Baht formatting
3. WHEN displaying quantities or measurements on frontend THEN the system SHALL use Arabic numerals
4. IF the user is viewing the application through a web browser THEN the system SHALL consistently use Arabic numerals for all numeric displays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner printing receipts, I want printed bills to show Thai numerals, so that my Thai customers can easily read the printed receipts in their familiar number format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN printing a bill to any printer THEN the system SHALL convert all Arabic numerals to Thai numerals (๐-๙)
2. WHEN printing to portable printers THEN the system SHALL use Thai numerals for all numeric content
3. WHEN printing currency amounts THEN the system SHALL display Thai numerals with proper Thai Baht formatting
4. WHEN printing dates on bills THEN the system SHALL use Thai numerals for B.E. years with "พ.ศ." prefix
5. IF a bill contains item quantities THEN the system SHALL display quantities using Thai numerals
6. WHEN printing invoice numbers or reference numbers THEN the system SHALL convert numeric portions to Thai numerals

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the number localization to be configurable, so that I can enable or disable Thai localization features based on business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing system configuration THEN the system SHALL provide options to enable/disable B.E. year display
2. WHEN accessing printer settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to enable/disable Thai numeral printing
3. IF Thai localization is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard Gregorian years and Arabic numerals
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring system restart
