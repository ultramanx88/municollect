# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing MuniCollect Next.js application to a modern monorepo architecture. The migration will transform the current single-stack application into a full-stack solution with a Go backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL database, and shared TypeScript types. The system will maintain all existing functionality while improving scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Monorepo Architecture Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured monorepo with clear separation of concerns, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain both frontend and backend components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project structure THEN the system SHALL create a turborepo-based monorepo with separate packages for backend, frontend, and shared code
2. WHEN organizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL maintain the following structure:
   - `apps/backend` (Go + Fiber + GORM)
   - `apps/frontend` (Next.js)
   - `packages/shared` (TypeScript types/interfaces)
3. WHEN configuring the monorepo THEN the system SHALL support parallel development and building of multiple packages
4. WHEN setting up version control THEN the system SHALL maintain Git compatibility with proper .gitignore configurations for each package

### Requirement 2: Backend API Development

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a robust Go-based API server, so that I can handle municipal payment processing with high performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL use Go with Fiber framework for HTTP routing and middleware
2. WHEN setting up data persistence THEN the system SHALL use GORM with PostgreSQL for database operations
3. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL implement all existing functionality including:
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Municipality management
   - Payment processing (waste management fees, water bills)
   - QR code generation
   - Transaction history
   - Notification handling
4. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL validate input using shared TypeScript interfaces converted to Go structs
5. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL maintain existing Firebase integration for notifications

### Requirement 3: Frontend Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the same intuitive interface and functionality, so that I can continue using the municipal payment system without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating the frontend THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing UX patterns and user flows
2. WHEN updating the UI THEN the system SHALL enhance visual design while maintaining usability
3. WHEN implementing API communication THEN the system SHALL connect to the new Go backend instead of current data sources
4. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL maintain PWA capabilities for mobile users
5. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL continue using Tailwind CSS with the existing color scheme and design guidelines
6. WHEN adding mobile features THEN the system SHALL include a splash screen for PWA installation

### Requirement 4: Database Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want seamless data migration from the current system to PostgreSQL, so that no user data or transaction history is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing user accounts, transaction history, and municipality configurations
2. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL with proper indexing for performance
3. WHEN creating database schema THEN the system SHALL implement proper relationships and constraints
4. WHEN handling migrations THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities for safe deployment
5. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency

### Requirement 5: Shared Type System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data types across frontend and backend, so that I can prevent type mismatches and improve development efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining data structures THEN the system SHALL create TypeScript interfaces in the shared package
2. WHEN using types in Go THEN the system SHALL generate or manually create equivalent Go structs
3. WHEN updating types THEN the system SHALL ensure synchronization between TypeScript and Go definitions
4. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL validate type consistency across the monorepo
5. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL import types from the shared package

### Requirement 6: Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient development and deployment workflows, so that I can work productively across multiple environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support `npm run dev` for frontend development with hot reload
2. WHEN developing the backend THEN the system SHALL support `go run ./cmd/server` for local API server
3. WHEN working with branches THEN the system SHALL support dev/staging/master workflow with proper CI/CD
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL integrate with Render.com using Git-based deployment
5. WHEN running in parallel THEN the system SHALL allow multiple developers to work on different packages simultaneously

### Requirement 7: Containerization and Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker support for consistent deployment across different environments, so that I can deploy to various VPS providers reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containerizing applications THEN the system SHALL provide Dockerfile configurations for both frontend and backend
2. WHEN deploying to VPS THEN the system SHALL support Docker Compose for local and production environments
3. WHEN setting up environments THEN the system SHALL maintain environment-specific configurations
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL allow independent scaling of frontend and backend services
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with Render.com's container deployment

### Requirement 8: Feature Preservation and Enhancement

**User Story:** As an end user, I want all current features to work seamlessly with improved performance, so that my municipal payment experience is enhanced rather than disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using authentication THEN the system SHALL maintain secure login/registration for residents and municipal staff
2. WHEN selecting services THEN the system SHALL continue supporting waste management fee and water bill payments
3. WHEN generating QR codes THEN the system SHALL create unique codes with prefilled payment details
4. WHEN supporting multiple municipalities THEN the system SHALL maintain independent payment accounts for each municipality
5. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display past payments and transaction details
6. WHEN receiving notifications THEN the system SHALL send push notifications for payment reminders and confirmations
7. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide PWA features with offline access and app-like experience
